## This article provides information on Renewing a License in the Malaysian HAM Radio System (MHRS). You can renew one or more licenses on the same application.

### Steps to Filing a Request to Renew a License in MHRS

   `Note: If you are taken to the My Applications page, click My Licenses to begin the steps below.`

2. On the left-side of the screen, click Renew Licenses.
3. Select the licenses and Click Add.
4. Click Continue to navigate through the application.
5. Sign your application and click Submit Application.

   `Note: By typing your first and last name in the name fields you have signed your Application.`
6. Payment can be made online as soon as you submit your application.

### Why can’t a see the licenses I want to renew in step 3?
There are a few possibilities:

- Licenses cannot be renewed earlier than 60 days before the expiration date.
- Licenses past the expiration date are placed in an “ineligible” list for a period of time. In step 3 above, click the button “Ineligible.” If the licenses appear, you can file a renewal application. However, you must also upload certain documents similar when you apply a new callsign.

### How do I know if my application is received at the MHRS?
Applications will appear either the next business day in MHRS Application Search or two businesses days later for applications filed on a weekend or federal holiday. Enter the file number in the MHRS Application Search to find your application.
